Implement client-server communication using socket programming and TCP as
transport layer protocol.
### Client Server Chat using UDP
Implement client-server communication using socket programming and UDP as
transport layer protocol.
### Distance Vector Routing
Implementing Distance Vector Routing Algorithm
### File Transfer Protocol
Implemented file transfer protocol where we read a file name and reverse the contents stored in the file and store it to another file
### Leaky Bucket Algorithm
Implement congestion control using a leaky bucket algorithm.
### Matrix Multiplication using UDP
Implement matrix multiplication by reading matrix from client side, perform multiplication in server side and print it in the client side.
### Multi-Chat(TCP)
Implement Multi chat using TCP
### Odd-Even numbers using UDP
Implement Odd-Even by reading numbers from client side, find odd and even numbers from server side and print it in the client side.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Stop and Wait</strong>->Sends one frame at a time and waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next. Simple but inefficient for long-distance communication.</td>
    <td><strong>Go-Back-N</strong>->Allows sending multiple frames before needing an acknowledgment, but if an error occurs, all frames from the error onward are retransmitted.</td>
    <td><strong>Selective Repeat</strong>->Sends multiple frames and retransmits only the specific frames that were lost or corrupted</td>
